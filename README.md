# Repercussion

A game created SiegeLord for the Ludum Dare 29.

## Goal of the game

Find the philosopher's stone and return back to the surface with it.

## Controls

* WASD -   Drill
* Arrows - Move
* Space -  Jump
* R -      Place support
* T -      Place torch

## Gameplay tips

You can climb on supports.

## Building

This was written using RustAllegro @ f21b2cd5e9c85920779d169dc1a1964054257040 and Rust at e01e78fd00c78fd3b7f92fb0d6d58e05801d5d38.

Also requires Allegro 5.0.10.1.

Once everything is in place (you can place RustAllegro .rlib's in the source directory), run `make` and hope it works.

I'll be providing binaries eventually, but for now grab me (SiegeLord) in #rust at irc.mozilla.org.
